# Vanilla_TFF
These files contain the pipeline used to quality analysis for RNA-seq, de novo assamble, anotation by GO, PFM and UniProt.
Eight cDNA libraries were sequenced, corresponding to four for each genotype during fruit development (Pre-pollinitation, pollinitation, post-pollinitation and fertilization) of two V. planifolia genotypes: CH-I (wild aromatic characteristic) and CH-VI (commercially aromatic characteristics).
83 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Functional analysis of these DEGs revealed a greater diversity of functional categories in the CH-I genotype, associated with development processes, secondary metabolism, defense responses and light sensitivity. In the other hand, the CH-VI genotype presented genes with differential expression related to processing of genetic information, floral development, circadian cycle and a slow development pattern in the FFT.
