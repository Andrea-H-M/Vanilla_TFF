These files contain the pipeline used to quality analysis for RNA-seq, de novo assamble, anotation by GO, PFM and UniProt.
Eight complementary cDNA libraries were sequenced, corresponding to four for each genotype during fruit development (Pre-pollinitation, pollinitation, post-pollinitation and fertilization) of two V. planifolia genotypes (CH-I and CH-VI).
83 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Functional analysis of these DEGs revealed, in CH-I, several metabolic pathways.
